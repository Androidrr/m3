# Mavic Clone
This is my build of the Mavic clone from [https://diyrc.co.uk/](https://diyrc.co.uk/).  I have tried to consolodate everything into one repo including a BOM with assembly instructions.  This build is still in the works, so it is most likely incomplete and I will continue updating it until the build is done.
